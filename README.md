#Introduction

User, group, and role management is one of the most critical aspects of enterprise applications. When handled manually, it often leads to inconsistencies, unauthorized access, and workflow inefficiencies.

Our project, “Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows using ServiceNow”, demonstrates how the ServiceNow platform can be customized to ensure secure, automated, and role-based access across organizational processes.

We designed a custom application that:

Defines and manages users, groups, and roles effectively.

Implements access control rules (ACLs) for security.

Uses business rules, workflows, and relationships for automation.

Provides a scalable and user-friendly system for handling identity and access management.


This project shows how ServiceNow’s low-code/no-code capabilities can extend beyond IT service management into enterprise security and workflow optimization.
